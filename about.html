        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 25px;">ACEing Autism - Pasadena @ The Athenaeum Club, Caltech</h2>
        <p>
            Our ACEing Autism - Pasadena branch was founded in Fall 2021, with our
            inaugural clinic taking place in Spring 2022. We started off with less
            than 10 students, and are now welcoming over 20 students for our
            Spring 2024 program. This community-based program welcomes volunteers not
            only from Caltech, but also from local high schools and the neighborhood.
            No tennis experience is required as our main goal is for everyone to have
            fun, while engaging in meaningful social interactions with our participants
            who are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
            What started as a way for Caltech students to engage with the larger
            community has evolved our Sunday clinics in a microcosm of Pasadena itself.
            We love how much the ACEing Pasadena family has grown in recent years
            and hope we can continue to serve the community in the future.
        </p>

                We currently run a 6-week clinic in the Fall (October - early December)
                and a 5-week clinic in the Spring (May - early June). Please check our
                homepage for the most up-to-date information about our program!
