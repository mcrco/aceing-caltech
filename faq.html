    <h2>General</h2>
    <button class="accordion">What is ACEing Autism?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        ACEing Autism is a national non-profit program that focuses on teaching children
        diagnosed with Autism social and communication skills through the sport of
        tennis. We are the Pasadena location and our clinics are held on the
        Caltech campus. Our program's main objective is for everyone to have fun!
        We hope that the participants can gain meaningful skills and that the
        volunteers can have a fulfilling experience from working with their
        participant.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Where can I find information about the program?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Please visit our <a href="\info">Info</a> page for specific details about
        our program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Do I need tennis experience to participate?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Neither volunteers nor participants need tennis experience. Because
        our program focuses on staying active and having fun, we teach
        introductory tennis movements to the participants. We have a quick
        volunteer training session before the first clinic of each season
        where we will give tips on teaching!
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">How often are the clinics?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        We currently run a 6-week clinic in the Fall (October-early December)
        and a 5-week clinic in the Spring (May-early June). Please check our
        <a href="\info">info page</a> for the most up-to-date information about our program!
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Is there a clinic in the summer? Why aren't the clinics year-round?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Because we rely largely on student volunteers and the support of
        the Caltech tennis teams, we do not run clinics outside of our designated
        times for Fall and Spring. Many students are off-campus in the summer, so
        our volunteer pool is much smaller during that time. The tennis teams at
        Caltech are also competing from January through May, making those months
        too busy to run our clinics. We are hoping to expand our availability in
        the future.

    <h2 >For Parents</h2>
    <button class="accordion">How do I sign my child up to participate?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Follow the instructions <a href="https://aceingautism.org/programs/pasadena-ca/">here</a>
        and we will reach out with more information. We are super excited to work with you!
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">When does registration usually open?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        We normally open registration for each program around 1-2 months before
        the program start date. Please check back regularly <a href ="https://aceingcaltech.com/info"> here</a> to get the most up to date information. </b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What should I expect from the clinic?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Welcome! We ask that parents arrive 15 minutes early for the first clinic
        so that we can introduce the participant to their paired volunteers and
        so the participant can get used to the new environment. We try to pair
        the same volunteers every week and assign 2 volunteers/child (subject to
        variation based on support level). <br>
        As we get to know your child through the clinics, we can switch up the
        volunteer pairings and adjust the environment (i.e. too many people is
        overwhelming, so we place the participant on a smaller court) based on
        your child's needs. <br>
          Before each clinic, please check-in at the desk and your volunteers will
        find you when the clinic starts. We start with a warm-up, then transition
        to different drills in hand-eye coordination and racquet techniques. At
        the end of each session, we play a group game with all the participants
        and volunteers, like Red Light, Green Light.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What can be done if we can't make it to a session?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Please send us an email at <a href = "mailto: pasadena@aceingautism.org">pasadena@aceingautism.org</a>
        as soon as you can! The executive team meets weekly to pair participants
        to volunteers, and the sooner we know who is attending, the better we
        can plan our clinic. Unfortunately, we do not have a make-up policy. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Is this a drop-off program?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        We are <b>NOT</b> a drop-off program. Parents are expected to stay for
        the duration of the clinic or have a designated guardian/caretaker
        responsible for the participant on-site. There are bleachers available
        for courtside seating.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What does the tuition cover?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        We don't directly handle payments nor receive money from ACEing Autism to
        run our clinics. We are completely operated through the help of volunteers.
        Tuition is minimal in order to ensure attendance and pay for supplies
        such as racquets, balls, nets, etc. Additionally, we provide t-shirts for
        the participants, snacks at each clinic, and a final celebration on the
        last clinic day that includes medals for all participants and food for
        everyone attending.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Are there scholarships available?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Yes! ACEing Autism provides scholarships to anyone in need of financial support.
         More information <a href="https://aceingautism.org/scholarships/#:~:text=Scholarships%20are%20available%20to%20anyone,are%20welcome%20to%20re%2Dapply.">here</a>.

    <h2>For Volunteers</h2>
    <button class="accordion">How do I sign up to volunteer?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Follow the instructions
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LAWPpYeChinaEY7RdqhhOZ77WuGL-tG1eZziCDCrtpw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>
        and we will reach out with more information. We are super excited to work with you!
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Is there an age limit to volunteer?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        We currently require volunteers to be at least in high school to volunteer.
        Additionally, volunteering requires some physical activity in order to
        demonstrate the exercises and to keep up with your participant, many of whom
        will be between the ages of 5-12.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">I don't know much about Autism. Can I still volunteer?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>
        Of course you can! The vast majority of our volunteers did not have prior experience working
        directly with children diagnosed Autism before our program. We only ask
        that volunteers are enthusiastic and ready to be active + have fun. This
        will go a long way in creating a positive volunteer experience.
        We provide training for our volunteers with teaching tips and provide
        active support for volunteers during our clinics.
      </p>
    </div>
      <button class="accordion">What is the commitment like for a volunteer?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          We ask that volunteers are able to make at least 3 of the sessions in
          any of our programs. This is largely because we like to pair participants
          with the same volunteers every week to help build familiarity in what
          can be an overwhelming environment. We also think volunteers get more
          out of the experience if they are able to form a close relationship with
          their paired participant! The commitment level is fairly low, as our
          weekly clinics are only 1 hour long.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">What should I do if I can't make it to a session I signed up for?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Please send us an email at <a href = "mailto: pasadena@aceingautism.org">pasadena@aceingautism.org</a>
          as soon as you can! We try to schedule so that participants can get
          work with the same volunteers every week, so we appreciate letting us know
          ahead of time if you can't make it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">What is a Court Lead? How can I become one?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Court Leads are volunteers who have been designated to lead a court at
          the clinic. They are responsible for going through the steps of the
          curriculum and demonstrating new drills. Not every court needs to be
          doing the same thing at the same time, and court leads can choose the
          exercises depending on the skill level of their court. <br>
          We normally select returning volunteers who have shown strong commitment
          to the program and exceptional engagement with the participants as Court
          Leads. If you're interested in becoming a Court Lead, please speak with
          one of the Executive members in-person after a session, or reach out
          via email at <a href = "mailto: pasadena@aceingautism.org">pasadena@aceingautism.org</a>.
