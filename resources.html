          <h1>Resources for Program Development</h1>
          <p>
              Starting a new program is difficult, especially if you don't know where
              to begin or what timeline to follow. Here, we've compiled some resources
              to help you along your ACEing journey. Please note that these are
              not officially sanctioned resources from ACEing Autism, but just
              some tips from our own experiences!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="module" id="where-to-begin">
          <h1>Where to Begin?</h1>
          <p>
            If you're here, you're interested in starting your own ACEing Autism branch!
            Hopefully, you've already been registered as a volunteer and have
            volunteered multiple times before with a different clinic. If not, we
            <b> strongly </b> recommend that you do so, so that you can better
            understand the expectations and demands of a program. <br>
            The ACEing Autism official website provides a
            <a href = "https://aceingautism.org/how-to-start-a-program/">nifty timeline graphic</a>
            that shows you how the usual process of getting a program started works.
            While we don't know how the selection process for new Program Managers
            works, Jen (the Pasadena branch founder) contacted ACEing Autism about
            starting our first program in May 2022 back in October 2021, so around
            the recommended 6 months before program start date as shown in the timeline.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="module" id="choosing-location">
          <h1>Choosing a Location</h1>
          <p>
            Even before your program manager phone interview is scheduled, you should
            consider where you want to host the program. For our clinic, the tennis courts
            at Caltech were an obvious choice, as they were close to campus with
            amenities like parking and bathrooms nearby. If you are affiliated
            with a school or university, evaluate how supportive the athletic
            administration would be regarding hosting the clinic on the school's
            facilities. If you are affiliated with a tennis club, maybe inquire
            if they would offer discounted rates for a non-profit program. If
            you are an individual who wants to contribute to the community, look
            into public tennis court facilities and whether they can be reserved.
            Location is a big factor in having a successful program; without courts,
            the program won't happen. ACEing Caltech has been lucky to have the
            support of both Caltech Athletics and the Caltech administration in
            acquiring court time and other resources for our clinics.
          </p>

        <div class="module" id="where-to-reach">
          <h1>Where to Reach Out</h1>
          <p>
            Congrats! You've been approved as a Program Manager and have secured
            court time for your programs' dates. Now, all you need are participants
            to attend. At this point, ACEing Autism will offer their own resources
            in helping you navigate the program planning timeline. However, there
            are programs all over the country and you know your community best.
            The most common way our program was advertised to our participants was
            through word-of-mouth. If you have a personal connection to the Autism
            community in your neighborhood, you can let people know personally
            about the new program. Additionally, posting flyers in communal spaces,
            sending emails to local public schools with special education programs or
            private schools that specialize in additional support services for
            children with Autism, are all good ways to let people know about the
            program.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="module" id="recruitment">
          <h1>Volunteer Recruitment</h1>
          <p>
            For the ACEing Autism - Pasadena program, we like to begin volunteer
            recruitment <b>before</b> we open registration in order to make sure
            we have enough resources to support all the participants who sign up.
            Volunteer recruitment can be tough, especially if your program is not
            connected to an academic institution. Even though our program is
            supported by Caltech and run by Caltech students/alums, we still placed
            a strong emphasis on recruitment outside of Caltech. </p>
            <ol>
              <li class="text"> Reach out to high schools, some of which may require community service hours. </li>
              <li class="text"> Find volunteer organizations on campus that you can advertise through via newsletters, etc. </li>
              <li class="text"> Use external websites, such as VolunteerMatch, so local community members can volunteer. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            ACEing Autism provides background checks for all volunteers and recommends
            about 2 volunteers per participant in each tennis clinic. The amount
            of volunteers you recruit is dependent on the support level of your
            participants, the reliability of your volunteers, etc. We recommend
            trying first to recruit volunteers from communities you're familiar with
            (i.e. asking your friend who loves working with kids to help out),
            before branching out further.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="module" id="training">
          <h1>Volunteer Training</h1>
          <p>
            We require all brand-new volunteers (never volunteered before anywhere for ACEing Autism)
            to attend an in-person training before the first session of the program.
            ACEing Autism has great resources to provide this in-person training; for
            our very first session back in May 2022, one of the National Directors
            came out to Pasadena to help train our volunteers for an hour before
            the clinic began. Now that our program is more established, we run
            the training ourselves for a half hour before the first clinic. <br>
            During the training, it is especially important for the volunteers to
            be engaged so that they can apply what they learned. We like to create
            a fun, interactive environment, where one volunteer demonstrates a drill to another
            volunteer, who stands in for the participant. We have also written up
            tips for volunteers to remember (see next section) and provide ongoing
            support during the clinic.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="module" id="tips-volunteers">
          <h1>Tips for Volunteers</h1>
          <p>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/v4-2.jpeg') }}" style="max-width:100%;max-height:100%;"/>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="module" id="manage-structure">
          <h1>Management Structure</h1>
          <p>
            We believe in creating a collaborative environment, so all executive
            members make decisions together at weekly meetings and work with
            each other to complete different tasks. The Program Director is
            usually responsible for establishing the agenda and leading
            the weekly discussions. The Assistant Program Director focuses on
            curriculum and quality assurance for the weekly clinics. The Logistics
            Director is primarily responsible for taking care of communications
            between the program and volunteers/parents. There is no strict
            hierarchy or responsibilities, however; we all help out on court when
            needed and work with each other in a team.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="module" id="parent-interaction">
          <h1>Interacting with Parents</h1>
          <p>
            While running your program, don't forget to talk to the parents and
            interact with them regularly! As a Program Director, the ideal situation
            is for the program to run smoothly enough so that the Court Leads and
            other support staff will take care of the participants on the court.
            Building relationships with the parents will establish an important
            line of communication about their child's needs, whether it's seeking advice on
            how to handle certain behaviors, or a conversation about whether the
            current volunteer pairing is working out well. This is one of the final
            steps in order to ensure a successful ACEing Autism program. <br>
            We hope these guides were helpful to you! Don't forget that this
            activity should be fun, and we wish you the same joy and fulfillment
            we get from running ACEing Caltech.
